# Compiler Warning XA0118

These warnings indicate an issue with the `$(NuGetTargetMoniker)` MSBuild
property in a Xamarin.Android project. This property is normally generated
automatically based on the `$(TargetFrameworkIdentifier)` and
`$(TargetFrameworkVersion)` properties, so these warnings should not arise in
normal use.

Consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are getting one of these warnings under
normal circumstances.
