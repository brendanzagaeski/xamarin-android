# Compiler Error/Warning ANDJS0000

This message indicates that the Java `jarsigner` command line tool used by
Xamarin.Android reported an error or warning.

Errors reported by `jarsigner` and other Android command line tooling are very
much outside of Xamarin.Android's control, so a general error code of
`ANDJS0000` is used reporting the exact message.

Learn more about `jarsigner` and its usage see the Java documentation
[here][jarsigner].
