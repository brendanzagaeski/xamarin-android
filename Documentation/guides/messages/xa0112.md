# Compiler Warning XA0112

Your project has `$(AndroidUseAapt2)` set to `True`. However `aapt2`
was not installed in your android-sdk build-tools.

If you want to use `aapt2` resource processing you need to install the
appropriate build-tools.

`aapt` is part of the Android SDK and is used internally by
Xamarin.Android to process and compile resources into binary assets.
Learn more about `aapt` and Android resources from the [Android
documentation][aapt].

`aapt2` is version 2.0 of `aapt` and is still somewhat poorly
documented. See the following links to learn more:
