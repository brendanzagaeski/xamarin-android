# Compiler Error/Warning ANDZA0000

This message indicates that the Android `zipalign` command line tool used by
Xamarin.Android reported an error or warning.

Errors reported by `zipalign` and other Android command line tooling are very
much outside of Xamarin.Android's control, so a general error code of
`ANDZA0000` is used reporting the exact message.

Learn more about `zipalign` and its usage see the Android documentation
[here][zipalign].
