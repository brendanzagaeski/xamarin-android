# Compiler error XA5205

This is a generic error when a required tool cannot be found.  You should check
that the Android SDK is installed and up to date.  Also make sure that the path
is set in the IDE.

Example messages:

  * <code>XA5205: The Android SDK Directory could not be found. Please set via `/p:AndroidSdkDirectory`.</code>
  * <code>XA5205: Cannot find `aapt`. Please install the Android SDK Build-tools package with the $(AndroidSdkDirectory)\\tools\\aapt program.</code>
  * <code>XA5205: Cannot find `zipalign`. Please install the Android SDK Build-tools package with the `$(AndroidSdkDirectory)\\tools\\zipalign` program.</code>
  * <code>XA5205: Cannot find `lint` in the Android SDK. Please set its path via `/p:LintToolPath`.</code>
