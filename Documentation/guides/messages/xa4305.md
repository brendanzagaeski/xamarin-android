# Xamarin.Android warning XA4305

## Example messages

```
Multidex is enabled, but the path of the merged keep file was not specified.
```

```
Multidex is enabled, but the merged keep file 'obj\Release\90\multidex.keep' does not exist.
```

## Issue

The path of the merged *multidex.keep* file for the `CompileToDalvik` or `R8`
MSBuild task was not specified or the file was not found on disk.

## Solution

The build process should automatically configure and populate the merged
*multidex.keep* file, so please consider submitting a [bug][bug] if you are
getting this warning under normal circumstances.
