# Compiler warning XA0101

The normal `@(Content)` Build action is not supported (as we haven't figured
out how to support it without a possibly costly first-run step).

If you wish to include additional content in your apk, such as textures
or audio for games, you should consider using `@(AndroidAsset)` or
`@(EmbeddedResource)`.
