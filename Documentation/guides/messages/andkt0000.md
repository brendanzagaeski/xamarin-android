# Compiler error/warning ANDJS0000

This message indicates that the Java `keytool` command line tool used by
Xamarin.Android reported an error or warning.

Errors reported by `keytool` and other Android command line tooling are outside
of Xamarin.Android's control, so a general error code of ANDKT0000 is used
reporting the exact message.

Learn more about `keytool` and its usage see the Java documentation
[here][keytool].
