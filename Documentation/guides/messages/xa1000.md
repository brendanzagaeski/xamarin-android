# Compiler warning XA1000

This warning means there was a problem parsing a layout XML file by the
`ManagedResourceParser`.  This is usually due to invalid or incomplete XML.

If the XML is invalid, your project will probably fail to build.  You should
investigate any formatting issues with the specified XML file.
