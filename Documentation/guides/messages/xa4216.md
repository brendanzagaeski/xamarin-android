# Compiler warning XA4216

This warning indicates your application is targeting an API level that
Xamarin.Android does not support.

`//uses-sdk/@android:targetSdkVersion` in *AndroidManifest.xml* to a
higher API level that is supported.

Example message:

    warning XA4216: AndroidManifest.xml //uses-sdk/@android:minSdkVersion '15' is less than API-16, this configuration is not supported.
