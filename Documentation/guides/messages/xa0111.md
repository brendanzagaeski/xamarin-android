# Compiler Warning XA0111

Xamarin.Android could not get the `aapt2` version via the command:

    aapt2 -version

`aapt2` did not return an expected value. 

Try re-installing the android build-tools.

`aapt` is part of the Android SDK and is used internally by
Xamarin.Android to process and compile resources into binary assets.
Learn more about `aapt` and Android resources from the [Android
documentation][aapt].

`aapt2` is version 2.0 of `aapt` and is still somewhat poorly
documented. See the following links to learn more:
