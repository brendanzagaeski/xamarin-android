### Issues fixed

  * [GitHub 3636](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/issues/3636):
    *Error inflating class android.support.v7.widget.FitWindowsLinearLayout ---> Java.Lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "android.support.v7.widget.FitWindowsLinearLayout"* and similar errors could prevent apps built with **Code shrinker** set to **ProGuard** or **r8** from running successfully unless custom ProGuard rules were added to the project by hand. In Xamarin.Android 10.x, projects configured to use AAPT2 now pass the `--proguard` option to AAPT2 to generate default ProGuard rules that more closely match the defaults for Android Studio projects, removing the need to add custom rules for common scenarios like the `FitWindowsLinearLayout` type from the Android Support Library.
